# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) tutorial

## Instructions

1. Bash the `kaggleAPI.sh` script. You will need to have a Kaggle account, installation and API credentials (learn more [here](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api)). You can either use a terminal from Linux/Mac OS or RStudio (learn more [here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010737148-Using-the-RStudio-Terminal)).
2. Install all packages listed on top of the script. `EBImage` is deposited in BioConductor, all other packages in CRAN.
3. Run `script.R`. The TensorFlow instalation defaults to CPU; alternatively you can use NVIDIA GPUs (if you have them) which run substantially faster.
